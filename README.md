# Project Summary

This was the first game I ever made. I actually made it 2 years ago but have just recently (March 2023) uploaded it to github. Creating different character designs was the reason for making this game. I decided I wanted to make a fighting game because of my love of Super Smash Brothers and watching a lot of other fighting games such as Guilty Gear, Street Fighter and Rivals of Aether. I had also just gotten into Beat Saber and decided to try and combine the two. My goal was to try and preserve the mind games of fighting games and create a cinematic fight on the rhythm of music.
